# Pillar Test Driven Development Kata

I have chosen to to do the Roman Numeral kata.

The project is a simple Maven project and should be able to be imported into any Java IDE.

There are two classes, ArabicToRomanNumeralKata and RomanToArabicNumeralKata, as well as a jUnit test class for each.

There is no Main class, all functionality is verified through running the unit tests.
